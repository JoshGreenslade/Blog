        <h3 class="section-title">Project Synopsis</h3>
        <p>
          For this project, I want to device that can passively sit on my shelf
          and warn me if the International Space Station (ISS) is overhead. I
          want it to be accurate, I want it to not need to be connected to my
          computer, and I want it to be attention grabbing enough if the ISS is
          overhead. In short, I hate trying to plan to catch the ISS ahead of
          time, and want to simply be able to glance at my shelf, see that it
          is, grab a jacket and head outside. Educated improvisation has always
          been more fun than rigorous planning!
        </p>
        <p>
          Whilst I trust my maths skills, the ISS frequently makes small
          adjustments to its orbit. So I don't think I can do this by just
          finding its position once, and then predicting ahead of time
          forevermore. I also don't want to have to update the position manually
          every time the ISS does move its orbit, so I needed something that
          could connect occasionally to the internet to update the precise
          position. I also wanted my device to be usable anywhere, not just
          cable-connected to my computer.
        </p>
        <p>Finally, after a few weeks of work, here is the result!</p>
        <img src="../img/Blog_006_NextPass.gif" alt="" class="border-all" />

        <h3 class="section-title">How does it work?</h3>
        <p>The board I uesd was an ESP8266 NodeMCU V1.0 ESP-12E WiFI Module.</p>
        <p>
          On first startup, the code makes a request to
          <a
            class="link"
            href="http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/ISS-Location-Now/"
            >the open notify ISS Location API</a
          >
          and
          <a
            class="link"
            href="http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/ISS-Pass-Times/"
            >next pass api.</a
          >
          This gets information about the ISS current latitude, longitude, the
          unix timestamp of when the next pass ovehead (defined as being > 10
          degrees above the horizon) will start , and the duration of that pass
          in seconds. After 5 seconds, it then polls the current location API
          once again. It then calculates the approximate velocity of the ISS in
          terms of latitude and longitude, and uses this information to update
          the position every 0.5 seconds. This is to prevent my board polling
          open-notify too frequently.
        </p>
        <img src="../img/Blog_006_NodeMCU.jpg" alt="" />
        <p>
          It only polls the next-pass API once the current pass has been
          completed, typically every 90 minutes or so. I had to add in a random
          number to this API call though, as the API seems to store the previous
          result and then return that if you call the API again using the same
          settings.
        </p>
        <p>
          The board updates its internal state every 10 seconds, flipping
          between displaying the current ISS position, and the time till the
          next pass. If the board thinks the ISS is overhead, based on the
          information given in the next-pass API result, it flips to a state
          where it flashes up that the ISS is overhead! A little commet symbol
          at the top of the screen updates its position across the screen to let
          you know how far into its passover the ISS is.
        </p>
        <img src="../img/Blog_006_Overhead.gif" alt="" class="border-all" />
        <p>
          I used an I2C OLED Display Module I2C SSD1306 Screen with 128x32
          pixels to display the results. I additionally use the excellent
          Adafruit library to write the actual display to the board. This
          library is great fun, and already I've got several neat ideas for
          other projects. Getting this wired up correctly was one of the harder
          parts of this project!
        </p>

        <h3 class="section-title">What to improve?</h3>
        <p>
          One obvious improvement is that the the tracker currently ahs zero
          casing, so all the wires are exposed ^^. I have a friend who owns a 3D
          printer, so I might spend a bit of time learning how to print a simple
          case for this so it doesn't look so wirey! I also want to update the
          software slightly; whilst the ISS passes overhead pretty frequently
          (every 90 minutes or so), most of the time it's not visible. This can
          be beacause it's daytime, or because both you and the ISS are in the
          shadow of the earth. The best time to see it is when you are in the
          dark and the ISS is in the light (usually around sunset or dawn).
          Having an extra attention-grabbing mechanism for when those passovers
          occur would be neat!
        </p>
        <h3 class="section-title">So what's next?</h3>
        <p>
          I haven't figured out how to add a comments section to these pages
          yet. Feel free to drop me a line though and i'll happily respond!
          Given the difficulty I had in writing this blog post, I think updating
          my webpage to be a bit more user friendly might be the next steps
          though! Am sure I can add in a comments section at the same time.
