I am really good at _starting_ projects.

I am also really bad at finishing them. Most of them barely got off the ground. I get excited at the start of the project, then by 30% of the way through I'm bored, or distracted by something else. Several conversations with other people have told me I'm not alone in this.

Back in June, I decided I was really fed up with this. There was lots I really wanted to learn & make, but I rarely could keep focus enough to actually make substantial progress towards any of them. With some good conversations with friends, I implemented a new project system with three simple rules:

>
1. I can only have __three__ projects active at any one time.
2. New project ideas are added to a backlog list
3. Only after completing a project can a new project be started.

This set of constraints has been a godsend. First, whenever I start a
project I now need to define pretty clearly what completing that
project means:
_No more poorly-defined totally beyond reach projects!_ Second, I
find it a lot easier to get over that hump of "I don't want to be
doing this project anymore", because I'm motivated to finish it by the
exciting new potential projects. Finally, it helps me contain my
overexcitable brain; most new project ideas simply don't get added to
the list because they don't stick around for long enough for me to get
round to them; only the projects I really want to do make it through
to the active-project phase.

There's little point making projects if you can't show them off
however. Project 005 has therefore been to make a homepage so I can
actually show off some of the things I work on.

This project involved me building a website from absolute scratch. No
pre-made themes, no download this tool that sets everything out for
you, just a new file called index.html, a text editor, and a bunch of
html & CSS. The website you are on is the result of that project.

I'm actually pretty happy with the result! It's fully responsive
(it'll look different on mobiles and tablets, try changing the size of
the window to see!), the rough theme (lots of white with strong black
lines) is...borrowed, but was all implemented in html & css.

That isn't to say that this website is great. There's a lot of stuff
wrong with it. For one, I still write all of the blog content directly
into the html itself, so having some kind of content management system
might be nice. Additionally, the structuring of some of the pages is a
bit poor, and I can imagine this site is hellish to look at if you're
in a dark environment. Still, these fixes are for another project. For
now, I'm happy with it.

Of course, this wasn't done from zero knowledge. Project 004 was going
through the excellent Udemy course run by Brad Traversy, [Modern HTML & CSS](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-html-css-from-the-beginning/)

Next up, I've got a fun new plan for the arduino. My pervious arduino
project, project 003, involved a light sensitive lamp, but this next
project will involve something a bit more out there...

The Skeletons by the way were demanded by Chris.
