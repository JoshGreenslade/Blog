        <p>I am really good at <i>starting</i> projects.</p>
        <p>
          I am also really bad at finishing them. Most of them barely got off
          the ground. I get excited at the start of the project, then by 30% of
          the way through I'm bored, or distracted by something else. Several
          conversations with other people have told me I'm not alone in this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Back in June, I decided I was really fed up with this. There was lots
          I really wanted to learn & make, but I rarely could keep focus enough
          to actually make substantial progress towards any of them. With some
          good conversations with friends, I implemented a new project system
          with three simple rules:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <ol>
            <li style="padding: 0">
              I can only have
              <span style="text-decoration: underline">three</span> projects
              active at any one time.
            </li>
            <li style="padding: 0">
              New project ideas are added to a backlog list.
            </li>
            <li style="padding: 0">
              Only after completing a project can a new project be started.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          This set of constraints has been a godsend. First, whenever I start a
          project I now need to define pretty clearly what completing that
          project means:
          <i>No more poorly-defined totally beyond reach projects!</i> Second, I
          find it a lot easier to get over that hump of "I don't want to be
          doing this project anymore", because I'm motivated to finish it by the
          exciting new potential projects. Finally, it helps me contain my
          overexcitable brain; most new project ideas simply don't get added to
          the list because they don't stick around for long enough for me to get
          round to them; only the projects I really want to do make it through
          to the active-project phase.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section-title">Building a homepage website</h3>
        <p>
          There's little point making projects if you can't show them off
          however. Project 005 has therefore been to make a homepage so I can
          actually show off some of the things I work on.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project involved me building a website from absolute scratch. No
          pre-made themes, no download this tool that sets everything out for
          you, just a new file called index.html, a text editor, and a bunch of
          html & CSS. The website you are on is the result of that project.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm actually pretty happy with the result! It's fully responsive
          (it'll look different on mobiles and tablets, try changing the size of
          the window to see!), the rough theme (lots of white with strong black
          lines) is...borrowed, but was all implemented in html & css.
        </p>
        <img src="../img/Blog_001_Homepage.PNG" alt="" class="border-all" />
        <p>
          That isn't to say that this website is great. There's a lot of stuff
          wrong with it. For one, I still write all of the blog content directly
          into the html itself, so having some kind of content management system
          might be nice. Additionally, the structuring of some of the pages is a
          bit poor, and I can imagine this site is hellish to look at if you're
          in a dark environment. Still, these fixes are for another project. For
          now, I'm happy with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, this wasn't done from zero knowledge. Project 004 was going
          through the excellent Udemy course run by Brad Traversy,
          <a
            style="color: steelblue"
            href="https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-html-css-from-the-beginning/"
            >Modern HTML & CSS</a
          >. Doing this would have been impossible without this help.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section-title">So what's next?</h3>
        <p>
          Next up, I've got a fun new plan for the arduino. My pervious arduino
          project, project 003, involved a light sensitive lamp, but this next
          project will involve something a bit more out there...
